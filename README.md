# Wear-Offline-Notes
App for writing offline notes with a custom keyboard for Android Wear.

I have implemented this project because I have got an old Android watch that the system soft keyboard does not work properly.
I wanted to save notes when I do sports and the requirements were the following ones:
- Easy to use 
- Completely offline behavior
- Save data in a persistent way
- Use a custom keyboard

The idea of using voice notes is not the best option for me.
I prefer write directly 1 or 2 words by keys and when I arrive at home, I do actions with those inputs stored.

This project has been implemented using part of the code and ideas of:
